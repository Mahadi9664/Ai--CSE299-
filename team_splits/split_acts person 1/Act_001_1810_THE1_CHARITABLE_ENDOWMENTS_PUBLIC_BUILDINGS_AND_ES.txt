In those cases, however, in which any of the buildings in question have fallen to decay, and cannot, from that or other causes, be conveniently repaired, or are not calculated if repaired to afford any material accommodation to the public, the6[Deputy Commissioner] shall recommend that they be sold on the public account, or otherwise disposed of, as may appear most expedient.

Section 15:
