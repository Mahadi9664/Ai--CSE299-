Section 1:
1.(1) This Act may be called the2[* * *]Alluvial Lands Act, 1920.(2) 	It extends to the whole of Bangladesh, except the district of Sylhet.


Section 2:
2. 	In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context,-(a) 	"alluvial land" means land which is gained from a river or the sea in any of the ways referred to in the Bengal Alluvion and Diluvion Regulation, 1825,3[***] or the BengalAlluvion (Amendment) Act, 1868, and includes reformations in situ; and(b) 	"Collector" means the Collector of a district or a sub-divisional officer or any other officer not below the rank of a Deputy Collector exercising the powers of a magistrate of the first class appointed by the Government, to discharge any of the functions of a Collector under this Act.


Section 3:
3.(1)4[The] Collector, if he is credibly informed that a dispute likely to cause a breach of the peace exists or is likely to arise, in regard to any alluvial land which in his opinion has recently firmed, may, after making an order in writing, stating the grounds therefor, in the interests of public order, attach such land, and may demarcate it with boundary pillars.5[(1a)  Where such land is situated within the limits of more than one district, or it is doubtful within the limits of which district or districts such land is situated any collector who considers that any portion of such land is situated within the limits of his district may, after recording his reasons therefor, attach the whole of such land. If, after attachment, such land or any portion thereof is found to be situated within any other district or is transferred to another district, the attachment shall continue to be valid but the Collector who attached the land may either transfer the case, in respect of the whole or any portion of the attached land, for disposal to the Collector of any such other district or may himself continue the proceedings under the provisions of this Act. The Collector to whom a case is transferred for disposal under this sub-section shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to have attached the land under this section.](2) 	When the Collector attaches any alluvial land under sub-section (1) or sub-section (1a), he may himself manage such land during the period of attachment, or may, if he thinks fit, appoint a receiver thereof, who, subject to the control of the Collector, shall have all such powers conferrable on a receiver appointed under theCode of Civil Procedure, 1908as may be given to him by the Collector:Provided that neither the Collector nor the receiver shall make a settlement or re-settlement of any land for a period exceeding one year nor shall he charge any salami for such settlement or re-settlement:Provided further that, in making such settlement or re-settlement of any land, the Collector or the receiver, as the case may be, shall give preference to the claim of a person who may appear to him to have right to immediate possession of such land6[* * *].(3) 	Nothing in this section shall preclude any party interested from showing, before the Collector makes an order of reference under section 5, sub-section (1), that no such dispute as aforesaid exists or that such dispute has ceased to exist and is not likely to arise either by reason of a compromise among the claimants included in the list prepared under section 4A or for any other reason and the Collector, if satisfied that no such dispute as aforesaid exists or that such dispute has ceased to exist and is not likely to arise shall cancel his order of attachment under sub-section (1), or sub-section (1a), and all further proceedings thereon shall be stayed. The Collector may, if he thinks fit, cancel his order of attachment under sub-section (1) or sub-section (1a) in respect of a portion of the attached land and continue proceedings in respect of the remainder of such land.(4) When an order of attachment of any alluvial land is cancelled under sub-section (3), the Collector shall issue a notice in the prescribed manner inviting claims to the net receipts from the land during attachment, and shall order the payment of such receipts to the persons who, in his opinion, are entitled to the same. The net receipts shall be calculated by deducting from the gross receipts the costs incurred under this section, and under section 4, sub-section (1), and section 4A, sub-section (1), and the cost of preparation of the reference to be made under section 5, sub-section (1), if any.(5) In estimating for the purposes of sub-section (4), section 5, and section 7 the costs incurred under this section, the following costs shall be included in the cost of management, namely:-7[* * *](b) 	the cost of special staff, if any, and(c) 	where no special staff is employed for collection, a sum not exceeding five per centum per annum on the actual collections.


Section 4:
4.(1) When the Collector has attached any alluvial land under section 3, he shall as soon as possible cause a survey to be made and a map to be prepared of the land, including the revenue, diara and other relevant survey lines.(2) 	The survey made under sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be survey under the8[* * *]Survey Act, 1875, and the Collector shall exercise in respect of such survey all powers which he is empowered to exercise for the purposes of inquiries and surveys under that Act.(3) 	Notwithstanding anything contained in section 83 of theEvidence Act, 1872, a map prepared under sub-section (1) shall be presumed by the Court to be accurate until the contrary is shown.


Section 5:
9[4A.(1) When the Collector has attached any alluvial land under section 3, he shall as soon as possible issue a notice in the prescribed manner calling upon all persons claiming title to any part of such land to file statements specifying their claims and	the grounds thereof, and the name and jurisdiction number of the village and the tauzi number of the estate to which they allege that the land appertains.If any of the aforesaid claimants is not a proprietor of such estate, he shall also mention in the statement the name of the landlord under whom he holds the land, the area and the rent of his tenancy and such other particulars as may be necessary to elucidate his claim.If the land is included in a map as prepared or a record-of-rights as finally published10[* * *], the claimant shall also mention the particulars of the khatians and plot numbers necessary to identify the land in the map or record-of-rights.(2) 	On receipt of a statement of claim referred to in sub-section (1) the Collector shall examine the claim and call for such further particulars, if any, as he considers necessary, and shall, if he is satisfied that the claim is bona fide, enter the name of the claimant in the list of claimants. The Collector may exclude from the said list the name of any claimant who fails to supply any of the required particulars. If any part of the attached land is claimed11[by the Government], the Collector shall12[include the Government] in the said list of claimants.(3) 	An application for inclusion in the list of claimants by a person with whom any of the land has been settled or resettled during the period of attachment shall not be considered unless it alleges a title independent of such settlement or resettlement.]


Section 6:
5.(1) When the survey and map referred to in section 4, sub-section (1), have been completed the Collector shall as soon as possible pass an order making a reference to the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the district for a decision as to what person has a title to the and, and shall include in the order the list of claimants referred to in section 4A and shall state-(a) 	whether any land claimed by any such claimant has been identified as being included in the land which is the subject of the reference,(b) 	the costs incurred under section 3, section 4, sub-section (1), section 4A, sub-section (1), and the cost of preparation of the reference made under this sub-section,(c) 	the value of the land, and(d) 	the names of any persons who have filed statements of claim under section 4A and whose names are not included in the list of claimants.In the case of any land referred to in section 3, sub-section (1a), the reference shall be made to the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the district in which, in the opinion of the Collector, the major portion of the attached land is situated.13[(1a) In making such reference the Collector shall advance the court-fees payable under theCourt-fees Act, 1870, on a plaint in a suit for determination of title to land and such process-fees as may be required for service of notices on the parties to the reference. The Collector may make such advance from the balance of the receipts at credit in his accounts of the attached land, or, if this is not practicable, may at any time recover such advance or any part thereof from such balance.](2) On receipt of a reference made under sub-section (1), the principal Civil Court of the district may either proceed to determine the matter or may transfer the matter for determination to any other Civil Court subordinate to such Court competent to try or dispose of a suit for the determination of title to the land.The said Court shall issue notices to all the persons mentioned in the list of claimants referred to in section 4A to appear and file statements of their respective claims. No other person shall be made a party to the reference unless the said Court is satisfied that for some reason not due to wilful default or negligence on the part of such person he was unable to file a statement of claim referred to in section 4A, sub-section (1), in due time or that the Collector has without sufficient reason held that such person's claim was not bona fide. A person pleading ignorance of the issue of the notice under that sub-section shall not be made a party to the reference unless he proves to the satisfaction of the said Court that he had no knowledge that the land had been attached. The said Court shall also determine which of the claimants has the right to begin at the hearing of the reference.(3) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, a reference made under sub-section (1), shall be deemed to be a suit for all the purposes of theCode of Civil Procedure, 1908, and every decision by a Civil Court under sub-section (2), shall be deemed to be a decree within the meaning of that Code and appealable as such.(4) The said Court shall decide to whom and in what proportions the net receipts, if any, from the land during attachment shall be paid. The net receipts shall be calculated by deducting from the gross receipts the costs incurred under section 3, section 4, sub-section (1), section 4A, sub-section (1), and the costs incurred by the Collector in the proceedings under this section including the cost of preparation of the reference made under sub-section (1).(5)	The said Court shall also decide by whom and in what proportions the costs incurred under section 3, section 4, sub-section (1), section 4A, sub-section (1), and the costs incurred by the Collector and by the other parties in the proceedings under this section including the cost of preparation of the reference made under sub-section (1), are payable.(6) 	If the costs referred to in sub-section (4) exceed the gross receipts the Court shall decide by whom and in what proportions the amount of such excess shall be payable, and such amount shall be recoverable by the Collector, in accordance with the decision of the Court, from the persons liable, as arrears of a public demand.(7) 	The person entitled to the net receipts may apply to the Court for the recovery from the persons liable of any amount deducted from the gross receipts in excess of the amount, so deducted, for which he is himself liable. If Government are entitle to the net receipts or to any part thereof the Collector may recover as arrears of a public demand any amount due to Government or may apply to the Court for the recovery of the same.(8) 	A reference made under sub-section (1) shall not be dismissed for default but the said Court shall decide the same after taking the evidence of such of the claimants mentioned by the Collector in the order of reference or added by the Court under section 5, sub-section (2), as it may think necessary.
